      <h1>Hi, I'm Damon!</h1>
      <p> 
        I'm an aspiring coder who is passionate about blockchain technology.<br> 
        My goals are to learn how to code and I'll be following the path of a front-end engineer, includng Javascript as my main langauge I want to learn to use. I'll also want to learn Solidity which is Ethereum's langauge, and this in combination with front-end engeering will allow me to develop smart contracts and more.<br>
        Ultimately I want to become a blockchain developer and be able to work remotely and/or contracting, which will  allow me to live and work anyhere in the world. <br>
                I started Nomaddamon as my first website, and I'll be updating things as I continue learning more.<br>
        <p>In my free time, I like cooking and eating great food, I worked as a chef for a few years when I was younger and have always been a foodie.</p>
